source{d} Machine Learning team's issues
========================================

What this is
------------

This is the list of issues which cannot be easily related to a particular GitHub
repository. They are typically tasks related to:

- Research
- Papers and other documentation
- Datasets
- Training and running models
- Code maintenance

How to use
----------

The issues can be created by everybody in the team after a brief prior discussion
with the team lead.

The title format is:

```
[topic] Objective
```

Please note:

- Square brackets
- Topic starts with a lowercase letter
- Whitespace after the topic
- Objective starts with an uppercase letter
- No dot in the end

### Standard topics

- EPIC codename or title
- `[research]`
- `[code]` for any maintenance or cross-project refactoring
- `[dataset]`
- `[idea]` for proposals which are specific to ML and do not fit into [feature-idea](https://github.com/src-d/feature-idea)
